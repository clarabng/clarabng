<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an incoming freshman at UC Davis hoping to major in cognitive science with a neuroscience emphasis. I enjoy baking and building Legos. A fun fact about me is I used to play basketball. Through E1T1, I hope to develop my tech skills because I've never learned any computer skills. I hope to improve upon my coding, web design, and software platform skills to prepare me for my future.</p>
